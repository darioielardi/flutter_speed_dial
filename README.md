## Usage

See [Example Code](example/lib/main.dart) or [Example Usage](#Example-Usage) for more info.

The SpeedDial widget is built to be placed in the `Scaffold.floatingActionButton` argument, replacing the `FloatingActionButton` widget.
It's not possible to set its position with the `Scaffold.floatingActionButtonLocation` argument, but it's possible to set right/bottom margin with the `marginEnd` and `marginBottom` arguments (default to 16) to place the button anywhere in the screen.
Using the `Scaffold.bottomNavigationBar` the floating button will be always placed above the bar, so the `BottomAppBar.hasNotch` should be always `false`.

**Labels**

SpeedDial and its child all have `label`. SpeedDial takes any Widget as `label`. It also have `activeLabel` property by which you can specify the label which is shown when SpeedDial is open. It also comes with its labelTransitionBuilder which defaults to fade transition.

Also Every child button have `label` property which accepts `String` which can be styled by using `labelStyle`. 
If the `label` parameter is not provided the label will be not rendered.

**Animated Icon**

The main floating action button child can set with the `icon` parameter, you can animate that icon by setting `activeIcon` paramater, It have four relatable paramters:

- `icon` & `activeIcon` takes an `IconData` widget
- `iconTheme` takes its theme which includes color and size


 however if you want to use an Animated icon by specifying `AnimatedIconData` then you can use `AnimatedIcon`, it has two specific parameters:

- `animatedIcon` takes an `AnimatedIconData` widget
- `animatedIconTheme` takes its theme

The package will handle the animation by itself.

**Hide on Scroll**

Another possibility is to make the button hide on scroll with a curve animation, with a `visible` parameter to set dynamically based on the scroll direction. See the [example project](example/lib/main.dart) for more info.

### Close on WillPop

Although it doesn't magically closes when you press back button, but requires a easier setup to enable this functionality, here are the steps that you need to do to enable that:

1. Add a value Notifier inside your widgets build context where your speedDial is placed like below.
```dart
ValueNotifier<bool> isDialOpen = ValueNotifier(false);
```
2. Then you need to add a property to your speedDial known as openCloseManually like below.
```dart
  openCloseDial: isDialOpen,
```
3. Add a will Pop in your body or anywhere where you want and then simply add the following line in its onWillPop element.
```dart
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async {
    if (isDialOpen.value) {
      isDialOpen.value = false;
      return false;
    }
    ...other checks here
  }
  child: ...your child goes here
)
```

### Example Usage

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    floatingActionButton: SpeedDial(
      /// both default to 16
      marginEnd: 18,
      marginBottom: 20,
      // animatedIcon: AnimatedIcons.menu_close,
      // animatedIconTheme: IconThemeData(size: 22.0),
      /// This is ignored if animatedIcon is non null
      icon: Icons.add,
      activeIcon: Icons.remove,
      // iconTheme: IconThemeData(color: Colors.grey[50], size: 30),
      /// The label of the main button.
      // label: Text("Open Speed Dial"),
      /// The active label of the main button, Defaults to label if not specified.
      // activeLabel: Text("Close Speed Dial"),
      /// Transition Builder between label and activeLabel, defaults to FadeTransition.
      // labelTransitionBuilder: (widget, animation) => ScaleTransition(scale: animation,child: widget),
      /// The below button size defaults to 56 itself, its the FAB size + It also affects relative padding and other elements
      buttonSize: 56.0,
      visible: true,
      /// If true user is forced to close dial manually 
      /// by tapping main button and overlay is not rendered.
      closeManually: false,
      /// If true overlay will render no matter what.
      renderOverlay: false,
      curve: Curves.bounceIn,
      overlayColor: Colors.black,
      overlayOpacity: 0.5,
      onOpen: () => print('OPENING DIAL'),
      onClose: () => print('DIAL CLOSED'),

      elevation: 8.0,
      shape: CircleBorder(),
      // orientation: SpeedDialOrientation.Up,
      // childMarginBottom: 2,
      // childMarginTop: 2,
      children: [
        SpeedDialChild(
          child: Icon(Icons.accessibility),
          backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          label: 'First',

          onLongPress: () => print('SECOND CHILD LONG PRESS'),
        ),
        SpeedDialChild(
          child: Icon(Icons.keyboard_voice),
          backgroundColor: Colors.green,
          label: 'Third',
          labelStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0),
